        <div class="paragraph"> An architect is a professional who designs buildings and spaces. Their job involves not only creating aesthetically pleasing structures but also ensuring that these structures are functional, safe, and sustainable.

They must have a strong understanding of architectural principles, building codes, and sustainability concepts. Architects need a combination of creativity, technical skills, and problem-solving abilities to create innovative and practical designs.</div>
